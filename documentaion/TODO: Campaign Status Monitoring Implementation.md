# TODO: Campaign Status Monitoring Implementation

## Step 5.2: Implement Campaign Status Monitoring
**Goal**: Add real-time campaign status tracking

**Actions**:
1. Create campaign status polling mechanism
2. Add visual status indicators and progress tracking
3. Implement error state handling for failed campaigns
4. Add campaign action controls (start, stop, retry)

**Verification Strategy**:
- Test campaign status polling during processing
- Test visual status indicators for different states
- Test error handling for failed campaigns
- Verify campaign action controls work properly

**Expected Outcome**: Real-time campaign status monitoring with proper user feedback

## Implementation Notes
- This feature is deferred to be implemented after the core CRUD operations are complete
- Should be implemented as part of Phase 5 Campaign Management Integration
- Consider using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- May require additional backend endpoints for status streaming

## Related Dependencies
- Must be implemented after Step 5.1 (Update Campaign API Integration)
- May require updates to campaign service and campaign detail pages
- Should integrate with existing campaign list and detail components
