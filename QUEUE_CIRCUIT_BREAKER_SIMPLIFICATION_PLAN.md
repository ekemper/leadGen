# Queue and Circuit Breaker Simplification Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan implements a comprehensive simplification of the queue/circuit breaker system by:
- **Removing campaign paused state** - campaigns will only have CREATED, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED states
- **Simplifying circuit breaker** - only OPEN and CLOSED states (removing HALF_OPEN)
- **Job-level state management** - jobs maintain paused state, campaigns remain RUNNING
- **Manual-only resume** - only frontend can close circuit breaker and resume operations
- **Removing unavailable_services complexity** - circuit breaker state is single source of truth

**ðŸŽ¯ Development Environment**: Since we're in development and all campaigns will be deleted during testing, this plan skips complex data migration procedures and focuses on clean implementation.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Current Complexity Issues
1. **Campaign paused state** complicates state machine with automatic resume logic
2. **unavailable_services** concept duplicates circuit breaker state tracking
3. **HALF_OPEN circuit breaker state** adds unnecessary complexity
4. **Multiple pause/resume triggers** create race conditions and unpredictable behavior
5. **Service-specific dependency tracking** over-complicates job routing decisions

### Current Patterns to Maintain
- **API JSON response format**: `{"status": "success", "data": {...}}`
- **Docker container execution**: Tests run in `leadgen-api-1` container
- **Database verification**: Tests check actual DB state after API calls
- **Migration pattern**: Use `flask db migrate` and `flask db upgrade`
- **Logging pattern**: Structured logging with context and error tracking

## Simplified Business Rules

### Circuit Breaker Rules
1. **Only two states**: OPEN (service down) and CLOSED (service working)
2. **Any service error** â†’ circuit breaker opens immediately
3. **Frontend manual action only** â†’ circuit breaker closes
4. **Single global state** â†’ there is only one global breaker state ( not based on services )

### Job State Management
1. **Breaker opens** â†’ all PENDING/RUNNING jobs â†’ PAUSED
2. **Breaker closes** â†’ all PAUSED jobs â†’ PENDING + new celery tasks created
3. **Jobs maintain pause reason** for troubleshooting
4. **No service-specific job filtering** â†’ all jobs affected equally

### Campaign State Management  
1. **Campaigns never pause** â†’ remain in RUNNING state even when breaker opens
2. **Job pause â‰  campaign pause** â†’ campaigns track overall progress, not individual failures
3. **Campaign completion** â†’ based on all jobs completed/failed, not pause state

## Post-Implementation: Update Concurrent Campaign Flow Test

### Step 24: Update test_concurrent_campaigns_flow.py for New Logic
**Goal**: Update the concurrent campaign flow test to work with simplified circuit breaker logic
**Actions**:
- Update `app/background_services/smoke_tests/test_concurrent_campaigns_flow.py`:
  - Replace campaign status polling with circuit breaker state polling
  - Update `wait_for_campaign_pause_propagation()` to `wait_for_circuit_breaker_open()`
  - Modify test logic to expect campaigns to remain RUNNING when circuit breaker opens
  - Update test assertions to check job pause status instead of campaign pause status
  - Simplify circuit breaker state checking to use global state only
- Update related utility functions in `app/background_services/smoke_tests/utils/`:
  - `circuit_breaker_utils.py`: Update to work with global circuit breaker state
  - `job_utils.py`: Update monitoring to focus on job state rather than campaign state
- Remove campaign-specific pause/resume logic from smoke tests

**Rationale**: 
With the new simplified logic:
- **Campaigns never pause** â†’ they remain RUNNING even when circuit breaker opens
- **Circuit breaker state** â†’ is the single source of truth for system health
- **Job state** â†’ is what actually pauses/resumes based on circuit breaker
- **Test continuation logic** â†’ should be based on circuit breaker state, not campaign status

**Success Criteria**:
- Smoke test polls circuit breaker state instead of campaign status
- Test correctly identifies when to continue based on global circuit breaker state
- Test assertions updated to expect campaigns to remain RUNNING
- Job state monitoring replaces campaign state monitoring
- Test passes with new simplified logic

**Validation Strategy**:
```bash
# Run the updated smoke test
python app/background_services/smoke_tests/test_concurrent_campaigns_flow.py

# Verify test logic with circuit breaker state changes
docker exec leadgen-api-1 python -c "
from app.core.circuit_breaker import get_circuit_breaker
from app.core.logger import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)

# Test circuit breaker state polling
cb = get_circuit_breaker()
state = cb.get_global_state()
logger.info(f'Global circuit breaker state: {state}')
print(f'Circuit breaker state: {state}')
"
```

**Key Changes Required**:

1. **Replace campaign status polling**:
```python
# OLD: Wait for campaigns to pause
def wait_for_campaign_pause_propagation(token, campaign_ids, api_base, timeout_seconds=30):
    # Wait for campaigns to change to PAUSED status
    
# NEW: Wait for circuit breaker to open
def wait_for_circuit_breaker_open(token, api_base, timeout_seconds=30):
    # Poll circuit breaker state until OPEN
```

2. **Update test continuation logic**:
```python
# OLD: Check if campaigns are paused to determine test continuation
if campaigns_paused:
    return "stop_test", "Campaigns paused due to service issues"

# NEW: Check circuit breaker state to determine test continuation  
if circuit_breaker_open:
    return "stop_test", "Circuit breaker open due to service issues"
```

3. **Simplify circuit breaker state checking**:
```python
# OLD: Check multiple service-specific circuit breakers
for service, status in circuit_breakers.items():
    if status.get("circuit_state") == "open":
        open_breakers.append(service)

# NEW: Check single global circuit breaker state
circuit_breaker_open = queue_status["data"]["circuit_breaker"]["state"] == "open"
```

4. **Update assertions to expect running campaigns**:
```python
# OLD: Expect campaigns to pause when circuit breaker opens
assert campaign_status == "PAUSED", "Campaign should be paused when circuit breaker opens"

# NEW: Expect campaigns to remain running when circuit breaker opens
assert campaign_status == "RUNNING", "Campaign should remain running when circuit breaker opens"
assert jobs_paused > 0, "Jobs should be paused when circuit breaker opens"
```

This update ensures the smoke test works correctly with the new simplified logic where circuit breaker state is the single source of truth for system health, and campaigns never pause regardless of circuit breaker state.

## Technical Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Job State Consistency Risk**
   - **Risk**: Jobs may be left in inconsistent states during circuit breaker transitions
   - **Mitigation**: Atomic job state updates with database transactions
   - **Rollback**: Database transaction rollback on any job state update failure

2. **Celery Task Creation Risk**
   - **Risk**: Resumed jobs may fail to create new celery tasks
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive retry logic and error handling for task creation
   - **Rollback**: Mark jobs as failed if task creation fails, maintain manual retry capability

### Medium-Risk Areas

3. **API Contract Breaking Changes**
   - **Risk**: Frontend or API clients may break with new simplified responses
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible, clear breaking change documentation. The updates to the front end will be performed Subsequently. just document the needed front end changes based on the refactoring of the endpoints.

4. **Circuit Breaker Race Conditions**
   - **Risk**: Concurrent requests during circuit breaker state changes may cause inconsistencies
   - **Mitigation**: Redis-based locking for circuit breaker state changes
   - **Rollback**: Circuit breaker state can be manually reset via API

- [ ] Remove `#TODO : this should only have to be evaluated if the job failure was something other than a third party api failure which will be handled by the circuit breaker logic` (app/services/job_status_handler.py:157)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: Depricated` (app/services/job_status_handler.py:211)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO; this class may be entirely Depricated` (app/services/job_status_handler.py:291)

### Queue Manager TODOs
- [ ] Remove `# TODO : this logic needs to be simplified - the open or closed state of the circuit breaker is the only source of truth needed for determining if a job can be run` (app/core/queue_manager.py:37)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO we can remove the dependencies on the job types, only the breaker matters, not which services are needed for which type of job` (app/core/queue_manager.py:39)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: this should be depricated - for pausing jobs, we will pause all of the jobs in a pending or running state regardless of what services that job depends on. please siimplify` (app/core/queue_manager.py:68)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: this should be depricated - for resuming jobs, we will put all of the jobs in a paused state back into a pending state regardless of what services that job depends on. please siimplify` (app/core/queue_manager.py:120)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO : simplify to just get paused jobs.` (app/core/queue_manager.py:158)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: utilize the relation between jobs and leads to gather the relevant info from the database` (app/core/queue_manager.py:187)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: depricated - we dont care about the per-service pausing of jobs` (app/core/queue_manager.py:235)

### API Endpoint TODOs
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: these campaign related schemas will have to be consolidated.` (app/api/endpoints/queue_management.py:35)
- [ ] Remove `#TODO : the cancel job post endpoint is redundant - please refactor usages of this endpoin to use the delete endpoint instead` (app/api/endpoints/jobs.py:168)

### Other TODOs
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: Add database and Redis connectivity checks` (app/api/endpoints/health.py:10)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO : even with the stubbed out call to millionverifier lets bring the rate limiting back so it can be tested` (app/background_services/email_verifier_service.py:67)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: Implement actual lead processing logic` (app/workers/campaign_tasks.py:682)
- [ ] Remove `processed_count = 0  # TODO: Replace with actual processing count` (app/workers/campaign_tasks.py:707)

### Test TODOs
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: In actual implementation, this should trigger campaign evaluation` (tests/test_job_status_integration.py:138)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: Replace with actual service integration` (tests/test_job_status_integration.py:623)
- [ ] Remove `# TODO: This will need service integration - for now simulate the trigger` (tests/test_campaign_status_refactor.py:146)

### Documentation TODOs
- [ ] Remove or complete `documentaion/TODO: Campaign Status Monitoring Implementation.md`

## General Implementation Rules

### Code Quality Standards
- **Complete working code only** - no placeholders or pseudo-code
- **Production-ready quality** - comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Maintain existing patterns** - follow established API response formats and conventions
- **Comprehensive testing** - test-driven development approach with immediate test validation
- **Documentation updates** - update docstrings and comments for all changes

### Technical Guidelines
- **Always question and validate** - challenge any unclear requirements or decisions
- **Ask for clarification** - when implementation details are ambiguous
- **Never make assumptions** - provide rationale for all decisions
- **Run tests immediately** - after each code change, validate with tests
- **Use Docker containers** - run commands in `leadgen-api-1` container for consistency
- **Follow migration patterns** - use `flask db migrate` and `flask db upgrade`
- **Preserve configuration** - do not modify `.env` files
- **Check container names** - use `docker ps` before running container commands
- **Use modern Docker Compose** - always use `docker compose` not `docker-compose`

This plan provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to simplifying the queue/circuit breaker system while maintaining system reliability and following established patterns. Each step includes clear success criteria and validation strategies to ensure the implementation meets the specified requirements.
