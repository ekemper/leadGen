# Queue Circuit Breaker Simplification - Technical Risks and Mitigation

## High Risk Areas

### 1. Database Schema Dependencies 
**Risk**: Campaign table requires `organization_id` which tests are not providing
**Impact**: Test failures and potential data integrity issues
**Mitigation**: 
- Update test fixtures to include required organization_id
- Consider making organization_id nullable for test scenarios
- Create test organization fixture to support campaign creation

### 2. Circuit Breaker API Contract Changes
**Risk**: Methods like `get_global_circuit_state()` don't exist yet
**Impact**: All dependent code will break during transition
**Mitigation**:
- Implement new methods with backward compatibility where possible
- Maintain old methods temporarily during transition
- Comprehensive testing at each step

### 3. Job State Consistency During Transition
**Risk**: Jobs may be left in inconsistent states during circuit breaker transitions
**Impact**: Jobs stuck in invalid states, potential data loss
**Mitigation**:
- Atomic database transactions for job state updates
- Comprehensive error handling and rollback procedures
- Database constraints to prevent invalid state transitions

### 4. Celery Task Management Complexity
**Risk**: Creating new celery tasks for resumed jobs may fail
**Impact**: Jobs resume but tasks never execute
**Mitigation**:
- Retry logic for task creation failures
- Mark jobs as failed if task creation repeatedly fails
- Monitoring and alerting for task creation failures

## Medium Risk Areas

### 5. Service Integration Breaking Changes
**Risk**: Service integrations expect service-specific circuit breaker logic
**Impact**: Services may not properly trigger circuit breaker
**Mitigation**:
- Update all service integrations to use global circuit breaker
- Maintain service error context while using global state
- Comprehensive integration testing

### 6. Campaign Event Handler Dependencies
**Risk**: Other parts of system depend on campaign event handler
**Impact**: Loss of important event tracking and notifications
**Mitigation**:
- Audit all dependencies before removal
- Move critical functionality to other components
- Maintain event logging for monitoring

### 7. Frontend API Contract Changes
**Risk**: Frontend expects service-specific circuit breaker controls
**Impact**: Frontend UI breaks or shows incorrect state
**Mitigation**:
- Document all breaking API changes
- Implement API versioning if needed
- Coordinate frontend updates with backend changes

## Breaking Changes Identified

### API Endpoint Changes
1. **Circuit Breaker Status Endpoint**
   - OLD: Returns service-specific states
   - NEW: Returns single global state
   - IMPACT: Frontend circuit breaker display

2. **Queue Management Endpoints**
   - OLD: Service-specific pause/resume
   - NEW: Global circuit breaker close only
   - IMPACT: Admin controls in frontend

3. **Campaign Status Endpoints**
   - OLD: Returns campaign PAUSED status
   - NEW: Never returns PAUSED status
   - IMPACT: Campaign monitoring and display

### Data Model Changes
1. **Campaign Status Enum**
   - REMOVING: CampaignStatus.PAUSED
   - IMPACT: Database migration required
   - MITIGATION: Ensure no campaigns in PAUSED state before migration

2. **Circuit Breaker State Storage**
   - OLD: Multiple Redis keys per service
   - NEW: Single global Redis key
   - IMPACT: Loss of service-specific state history
   - MITIGATION: Migrate existing state to global format

### Method Signature Changes
1. **Circuit Breaker Methods**
   - OLD: `record_failure(service, error, error_type)`
   - NEW: `record_failure(error)`
   - IMPACT: All service integrations

2. **Queue Manager Methods**
   - OLD: `pause_jobs_for_service(service)`
   - NEW: `pause_all_jobs_on_breaker_open(reason)`
   - IMPACT: Job management logic

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Code Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous working commit
git log --oneline -10  # Find previous working commit
git revert <commit_hash>

# Or restore from backup branch
git checkout backup-before-simplification
git checkout -b rollback-branch
```

### 2. Database Rollback
```bash
# Rollback specific migration
docker exec leadgen-api-1 flask db downgrade <previous_revision>

# Or complete database reset (development only)
docker exec leadgen-api-1 flask db downgrade base
docker exec leadgen-api-1 flask db upgrade
```

### 3. Redis State Reset
```bash
# Clear all circuit breaker state
docker exec leadgen-redis-1 redis-cli FLUSHDB

# Or selective cleanup
docker exec leadgen-redis-1 redis-cli --pattern "circuit*" --eval "for k in \$(redis-cli --scan --pattern KEYS[1]); do redis-cli del \$k; done"
```

### 4. Service State Reset
```bash
# Restart all services to reset in-memory state
docker compose restart

# Or restart specific services
docker compose restart leadgen-api-1 leadgen-worker-1
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Incremental Implementation
- Implement each phase completely before moving to next
- Run full test suite after each major change
- Validate database state after each migration

### 2. Comprehensive Testing
- Test all edge cases for state transitions
- Load test with multiple concurrent operations
- Validate rollback procedures work correctly

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor circuit breaker state changes
- Alert on job state inconsistencies
- Track celery task creation failures

### 4. Data Validation
- Add database constraints where possible
- Validate state transitions at application level
- Regular consistency checks via scripts

## Development Environment Specifics

### Safe Development Practices
Since this is development environment:
- All campaigns will be deleted during testing
- Database can be completely reset if needed
- No production data at risk
- Can iterate rapidly without data preservation concerns

### Testing Strategy
- Run tests after each phase completion
- Use docker exec for consistent environment
- Validate container state before each test run
- Clear database between major test runs

### Container Dependencies
- Ensure PostgreSQL and Redis containers are healthy
- Verify network connectivity between containers
- Check container logs for any underlying issues
- Use consistent container names (`leadgen-api-1`, `leadgen-redis-1`, etc.)

## Success Validation

### After Each Phase
1. All tests pass for that phase
2. Database state is consistent
3. Redis state is as expected
4. No error logs in containers
5. Manual API testing confirms expected behavior

### Final Validation
1. Complete test suite passes
2. Smoke tests with real scenarios work
3. All TODOs removed from codebase
4. Documentation updated
5. Performance benchmarks maintained
