,"Welcome to BBFF Heat Maps! There is NOTHING like this out there, so please take a few moments to understand the best way to use the heat map to crush your fantasy opponent.",,,,,,
,"How to Use This Resource  

This is best used on a computer, NOT your phone. If you would like to use your phone, download the Google Sheets app first. 

Here's how I recommend using the heat map to set your lineup: 

1. If there's a specific player you're looking for, simply ""search"" for their name (""Ctrl + F"" on PC or ""Command + F"" on Mac) and then click on it to see the note.

2. If you're looking for plug-and-plays from the waiver wire (or for a low-cost DFS punt), columns B and C are a great place to start; you'll see less-common names appearing higher than normal when they have strong matchups.

3. When looking for a DEF or K, I recommend using the ""implied"" column on the left to assist with those decisions. For Defenses, look for opponents that are expected to score a very low amount of points (colored in red). For Kickers, look for teams that are expected to score a lot (colored in green) and have an implied total that signals field goals (27, for example, implies 3 extra points and 2 field goals). Alternatively, I started listing plug-and-play options on the ""streamer"" tab.

MOST IMPORTANTLY: The most valuable information here are the detailed player analyses. Click on a player's name to read why they are in the column they are and get unique insights.",,,,,,"How NOT to Use This Resource  

These ARE NOT RANKINGS. 

1. Players listed from top to bottom ARE NOT ""ranked."" That's merely the order in which I conducted their analysis. 

2. Likewise, players listed from left to right is NOT meant to definitively indicate I'd start a higher-columned player over a lower-columned player. 

3. The purpose of the columns is to indicate how I feel each player will perform against what we normally expect from them. So if Stefon Diggs is in a tough matchup that lands him in Column D, that doesn't mean ""don't start him."" It means be prepared for a lower week than you're used to. 

TLDR: Don't compare one player's placement in the map to another player's placement in the map; that's not how this works."

,"Technical Notes 

On the off-chance the player notes won't load for you, refresh your browser. If that doesn't work, log out of Google and log back in. If that doesn't work, please let me know. 

Vegas information (over/unders, spreads, implied totals, etc.) are pulled from FanDuel Sportsbook and updated throughout the week. Note that the player write-ups may say slightly different numbers, as I may not change each individual player's note each time a line moves. Assume the data for the team is the most up-to-date. 

Last but not least, note that the ""win by/lose by"" column is how much each team is expected to win/lose by. It's basically the same as a ""spread"" but for spreadsheet purposes, I needed to use positive and negative numbers.",,,,,,"Remember to bring your most pressing start/sit (or other) dilemmas into ""The Basement,"" our subscribers-only Discord channel filled with 201 (and counting) other fantasy football brains that are helping each other out every week!"
